## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Resource Right-Sizing

```yaml
Strategies:
  Node Groups:
    - Monitor CPU/Memory utilization
    - Use metrics to adjust instance sizes
    - Implement horizontal auto-scaling

  Redis:
    - Track memory usage patterns
    - Use appropriate instance family
    - Enable data tiering when available

Potential Savings: 20-30% of compute costs
```

### 2. Spot Instances

```yaml
Implementation:
  Workloads:
    Suitable:
      - Stateless applications
      - Batch processing
      - Non-critical services
    
    Not Suitable:
      - Critical API endpoints
      - Stateful services
      - Real-time processing

Configuration:
  Node Groups:
    - Mix of On-Demand and Spot instances
    - Spot instance diversification
    - Fallback strategies

Potential Savings: 60-70% on eligible workloads
```

### 3. Auto-Scaling

```yaml
Configurations:
  Cluster Autoscaler:
    min_nodes: 2
    max_nodes: 6
    scale_up_threshold: 80%
    scale_down_threshold: 40%

  Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:
    min_replicas: 2
    max_replicas: 10
    target_cpu_utilization: 70%
    target_memory_utilization: 80%

Estimated Savings: 15-25% of compute costs
```

### 4. Storage Optimization

```yaml
Strategies:
  S3:
    - Lifecycle policies
    - Intelligent-Tiering
    - Compression

  EBS:
    - Right-size volumes
    - Use gp3 over gp2
    - Regular snapshot cleanup

  Redis:
    - Configure maxmemory-policy
    - Implement TTL for cached items
    - Monitor memory fragmentation

Potential Savings: 10-20% of storage costs
```

## Cost Comparison by Scale

### Small Scale (Up to 100k requests/day)
```yaml
Configuration:
  Nodes: 2 x t3.medium
  Redis: cache.t3.medium
  Storage: Minimal

Monthly Cost Range: $300-500
Cost per Million Requests: ~$150
```

### Medium Scale (Up to 1M requests/day)
```yaml
Configuration:
  Nodes: 3 x t3.large
  Redis: cache.r6g.large
  Storage: Moderate

Monthly Cost Range: $800-1,200
Cost per Million Requests: ~$100
```

### Large Scale (Up to 10M requests/day)
```yaml
Configuration:
  Nodes: 6 x r6g.xlarge
  Redis: cache.r6g.xlarge
  Storage: High

Monthly Cost Range: $2,000-3,000
Cost per Million Requests: ~$80
```

## Cost Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics

  - CPUUtilization
  - MemoryUtilization
  - NetworkIn/Out
  - CacheHitRate
  - APIRequestCount

Alarms:
  Cost Related:
    - High data transfer
    - Low cache hit rates
    - Underutilized instances
